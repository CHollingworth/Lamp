# Getting started 

> Lampray is a mod manager for gaming on Linux. Whether you're new to Lampray or a long-time user, the docs are a valuable way to learn how to build, use, and customize Lampray.

## Installation 

> To build Lampray from source, see [Building from source](./building-from-source.md).

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/CHollingworth/Lampray/releases) of Lampray, then move the executable to any location of your choice. For example:

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/Lampray ~
```

Give Lampray the execute permission.

```bash
chmod +x ~/Lampray
```

Launch the Lampray application.

```bash
~/Lampray/Build/Lampray
```

The first time you run Lampray, the following files and directories will be created:

```bash
~
├── imgui.ini
├── Lamp_Data
│   ├── Archives
│   ├── Config
│   ├── Deployment
│   └── Mod_Lists
├── lamp.log
└── Lampray
```
