### Q: Why is Lampray not opening?

**A:** Make sure all the [dependencies are installed](../README.md#dependencies). If your error persists, [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/CHollingworth/Lampray/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=-game--bug-report.md&title=) and send us your terminal output.

### Q: Why is "Deploy" not installing my mods?

### Q: Where can I find Canary updates or pre-releases they are no longer on GitHub?

**A:** You can find these in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/5macMedevy).
